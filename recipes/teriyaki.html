        <p>This grilled teriyaki chicken is very easy to prepare and great for a hot summer's evening.
            Leftovers are delicious on a green salad or in a sandwich. Be sure to grill very hot and very fast.</p>

        <h1> Ingredients </h1>


        <ul>
            <li>1 cup teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves/li>
        </ul>

        <h1> Steps </h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and sesame oil together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to overnight, turning every so often.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
